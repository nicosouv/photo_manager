# Photo Manager Project

## Setup

### Formatter
Install [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) to format your code on save.
On Pycharm, you can setup directly Black in Tools > Black, then select "on save" too, so that, no surprises on PR/MR.

### Config
You can create a `config.local.json` (on project root) with the desired settings.

## Launch

### Example
Test the app with this example command:
```bash
$ python cli.py --input /home/nico/Pictures/iPhone/110APPLE/
```
